This was one of my first tries at creating a game engine. I learned a lot from this project. It has a lot more functionality than my new one, but also a lot more problems
this is where I found out the issues of not thinking about the game loop as much as I should when designing a game engine. I was trying to create an RPG with this, however I
spent a long time on just the engine. The plan was never to actually finish making a game, but instead to learn how to program by doing a large project. This project taught me a lot about figuring out how to build building blocks that I would be able to utilize to make more complex ideas. It also taught me how to debug code that had many parts to it and discover where they came from.
