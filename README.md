This was one of my first tries at creating a game egine I learned a lot form this project. Has a lot more functionality then my new one ,but also a lot more problems
this is where I found out the issues of not thinking about the game loop as much as I should when designing a game engine.I was trying to create a RPG with this ,but
speant a long time on just the engine. THe plan was never to actually finish anything ,but instead to learn how to program by doing a big project. I could have created
a game with a game engien already but that was never the point of the project
